# JavaScript Quiz

This is a simple website in which users can check their JS knowledge by taking a quick quiz.

The purpose of this project is to practice how to decompose & plan projects, organize your code, and use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

What is new about this project? With this project you should also learn how to use **State**. This is a fancy programming term to talk about the data stored by your web pages. Nearly every app you use has state -> message histories, images, profile details, weather reports, â€¦ you name it!

To help you understand and debug your projects you will learn about logging - this is a technique where you store a record of every user interaction, all user input, and each state change. With this technique you will find that it is helpful way to simplify and understand what is happening in your program.
